## In-tree build

With this directory as your pwd run the following command.  The
CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH assumes you're on macOS and getting LLVM via brew.  If not, do
whatever makes sense for your platform.


```
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake .. -G Ninja -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/usr/local/opt/llvm
ninja all
./expr_test
```
